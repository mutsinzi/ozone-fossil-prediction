# Ozone Level Prediction using Fossil Fuel Consumption Data

This research project investigates the relationship between fossil fuel consumption patterns and atmospheric ozone concentrations across different global regions from 2018 to 2022.

## Research Question

Can we predict ozone levels at different heights in the atmosphere in different global regions (North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East) from 2018 to 2022 using past fossil fuel consumption (coal, gas, and oil)?

## Project Overview

This study explores the relationship between fossil fuel consumption and ozone variability through a three-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Data Integration and Preparation
- Spatial alignment of TROPESS ozone profiles
- Integration with national energy consumption data (2018-2022)
- Geospatial merging for unified dataset creation

### Phase 2: Statistical Modeling
- Feature engineering incorporating:
  - Sector-specific emissions
  - Socioeconomic variables
- Machine learning model development
  - Training period: 2018-2021
  - Prediction target: 2022
  - Performance evaluation using standard metrics

### Phase 3: Policy Analysis
- Mapping of ozone-emission hotspots
- Key sector identification for mitigation
- Development of evidence-based reduction strategies

## Data Sources

- Atmospheric ozone data: TROPESS profiles
- Heights analyzed: 1000hPa, 500hPa, and 100hPa
- Fossil fuel consumption data by region and type (coal, gas, oil)

## Geographic Scope

- North America
- Europe
- Asia
- Africa
- Middle East
